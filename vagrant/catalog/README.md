# Catalog Details

Database_setup.py contains the database setup script. Run with ```python database_setup.py```

Run the application with ```python finalProject.py```. Application runs on port 5000.

I did not see a requirement to provide the categories for the application nor to provide crud methods for the categories, only for the items. If I need to add default categories please let me know and I will update it.
